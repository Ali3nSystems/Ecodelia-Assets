The raw normal map "tset_1-pistol-raw_normal" doesn't have any barrel rifling by default.
This is mainly because people may want different types of rifling on their barrel (polygonal rifling, no rifling at all, etc).
In case you didn't want any custom rifling, I left in here a normal map which contains standard barrel rifling.
You may use GIMP or Photoshop to overlay it on top of the normal map I specified earlier.
